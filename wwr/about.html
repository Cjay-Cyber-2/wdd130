            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>
                Our history weaves through fast currents and friendly faces. Established by river enthusiasts, we have
                grown into
                a trusted crew of guides who love sharing the outdoors.
                we have 12 year experience and we were first founded by our C.E.O chijioke joseph.
                who founded the company on his own with just one single branch in the whole country canada at that time.
                Right now we are in over 36 parts of different countries in the world.
